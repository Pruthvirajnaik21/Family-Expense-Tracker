# Family-Expense-Tracker
A Family Expense Tracker built with Django is a web application that helps families manage and track their expenses. It allows users to log income, categorize expenses, set budgets, and view spending analytics. Key features include user authentication, expense management, budget tracking, and visual reports. The project uses Django’s built-in tools like the admin panel, forms, and authentication system to store and manage data securely. It’s a practical way to learn Django while building a useful tool for personal finance management.

User Authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their own family accounts.
Expense Management: Add, edit, or delete expenses, categorized by types such as groceries, bills, entertainment, etc.
Income Tracking: Record family income sources to compare against expenses.
Budgeting: Set monthly or yearly budget goals and track how well the family is sticking to them.
